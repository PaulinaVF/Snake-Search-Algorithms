# Snake-Search-Algorithms
This program uses different IA Search Algorithms to solve a problem.
The problem: There's a grid where you place obstacles and the program has to find a way from point A to point B, if there's any, else it just stays the closest it could get.
Depending on the algorithm you can see how the ways found from point A to point be can improve.
